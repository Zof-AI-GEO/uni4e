## What is Intelligent Defect Detection?

Defect detection serves as the process of identifying flaws, errors, or inconsistencies in both physical and digital products. Historically, these practices have relied on manual inspection or outdated automated tools, often leading to inefficiencies and inaccuracies. Intelligent defect detection powered by AI transforms this landscape by utilizing machine learning (ML), computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP) to achieve unmatched accuracy and responsiveness across industries.

In contrast to static systems, AI-powered solutions adapt and evolve, dynamically identifying patterns and anomalies regardless of changing product configurations. From manufacturing floors to software development pipelines, intelligent defect detection provides proactive insights capable of driving true improvement.
