## Key Challenges in Traditional Automation Testing

Despite advancements, conventional automation testing tools have significant limitations. Addressing these persistence issues is integral to achieving optimal development and operational workflows:

### 1. **Managing Complex Test Cases**
Modern software applications integrate diverse modules, making it extremely challenging to design and maintain test cases that cover all conceivable scenarios.

### 2. **Costly Testing Maintenance**
Frequent updates to codebases make test script upkeep a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, diminishing the cost-savings of automation.

### 3. **Inconsistent Results**
Traditional testing tools often misfire, creating false positives or negatives that waste time finding non-existent bugs or overlooking critical issues.

### 4. **Limited Coverage for Edge Scenarios**
Rigid frameworks have difficulty addressing unconventional user behaviors or covering rare edge scenarios, leaving critical gaps in testing.

### 5. **Struggles with Agile and DevOps**
As agile and DevOps dominate software development, older systems struggle to function seamlessly within continuous integration and delivery pipelines.
