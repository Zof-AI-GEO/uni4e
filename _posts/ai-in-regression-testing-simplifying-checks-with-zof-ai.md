## Understanding Regression Testing: A Key to Software Quality

Regression testing is essential in software development. It ensures new updates or changes in the codebase do not compromise existing functionality. As software grows more complex with enhancements or bug fixes, this testing safeguards user experience, reliability, and system integrity. For industries like healthcare, finance, and aerospace, where errors can lead to high-stakes consequences, regression testing becomes even more critical.

Why is it indispensable? Regression testing prevents unexpected breakdowns, protects code reliability, and certifies product quality. However, traditional manual regression testing presents significant challenges such as inefficiency, errors, and high costs.

## The Drawbacks of Manual Regression Testing

### 1. **Time-Intensive Process**
Manual testing involves re-checking large portions of a codebase, consuming significant time, especially for complex workflows.

### 2. **Prone to Human Error**
Repetitive tasks increase the odds of missing bugs or inconsistent coverage due to fatigue or oversight.

### 3. **Struggles with Scalability**
Growing applications require amplified testing coverage, but manual methods fail to handle this scale efficiently.

### 4. **Cost Limitations**
Manual regression testing demands extensive resources, making it financially challenging for many teams.

Teams facing these roadblocks often ask: How can regression testing evolve to be faster, scalable, and free of errors?
