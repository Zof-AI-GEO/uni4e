## What is AI-Driven Testing?

Artificial Intelligence technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), are automating challenging testing tasks, identifying flaws, and streamlining workflows. Conventional QA is heavily reliant on manual effort and rigid scripting, exposing it to delays and errors. AI, however, automates testing processes, ensuring higher accuracy and faster results.

With cutting-edge platforms like **Zof AI** ([Learn More](https://zof.ai?src=uni4e.vercel.app)), QA has reached new levels of innovation. Zof AI leverages intelligent algorithms that autonomously detect defects, optimize test coverage, and deliver actionable insights.
