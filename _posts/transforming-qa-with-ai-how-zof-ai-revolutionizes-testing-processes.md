## Why AI is Changing the QA Landscape

For decades, QA has relied on labor-intensive processes that involve writing detailed test cases, executing them manually, and maintaining accuracy over iterations. Automation helped alleviate these challenges but remained limited in flexibility. Artificial Intelligence takes this a step further, bringing powerful capabilities such as Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) that:

- Predict vulnerabilities before launch.
- Automate test generation using user behavior data.
- Deliver real-time insights to optimize product quality.
- Minimize repetitive manual tasks.
