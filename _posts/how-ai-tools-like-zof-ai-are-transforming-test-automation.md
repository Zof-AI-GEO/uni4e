## Why Traditional Test Automation Falls Short

While traditional test automation relies on static, repetitive scripts, evolving applications expose numerous drawbacks. These include: 

### 1. **Rigid Scripts**
Manually updating static scripts for application changes requires time and effort, slowing productivity.

### 2. **Time-Draining Maintenance**
Managing and rewriting static test cases eats away at resources and introduces potential errors.

### 3. **Inadequate Test Coverage**
Focusing only on predefined tests leaves gaps, risking critical features going untested.

### 4. **Lack of Real-Time Adaptability**
Traditional methods fail to simulate dynamic real-world scenarios, compromising testing accuracy.

AI-powered tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) bypass these struggles through adaptive, intelligent systems.
