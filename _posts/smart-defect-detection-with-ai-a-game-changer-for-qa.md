## The Challenges of Traditional Defect Detection Processes

Traditional defect detection involves using manual inspections or semi-automated tools to identify product flaws. However, this approach comes with significant shortcomings:

1. **Human Error**: Fatigue or subjective judgment often results in overlooked flaws.
2. **Slow Processes**: Manual and semi-automated approaches consume substantial time, especially for high-scale projects.
3. **Incomplete Analysis**: Subtle defects beyond human comprehension often go undetected.
4. **Inflexibility**: Static benchmarks valued in traditional QA fail to adapt to modern, ever-changing product requirements.

Despite gradual improvements, industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and software development struggle to manage defects efficiently amidst fast-paced technological advancements. AI offers a game-changing alternative.
