## The Challenges of Manual QA Testing

Manual QA, despite its precision, faces mounting obstacles in modern development:

### 1. **Time Pressure**
Manual testing requires significant time, making it challenging to test thoroughly during accelerated production cycles, often compromising test coverage.

### 2. **Human Oversight**
Even experts face fatigue and errors due to repetitive tasks, particularly in regression and stress testing.

### 3. **Limited Scalability**
As projects grow complex, manual testing falters in scaling across integrated systems.

### 4. **High Costs**
Labor-intensive processes inflate budgets without maximizing ROI.

Traditional QA alone cannot meet modern demands—AI steps in as the solution to streamline processes while enhancing results.
