## What is Continuous Testing?

Continuous testing integrates automated tests throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring code quality and functionality at every stage. Unlike traditional QA models, which occur late in the process, continuous testing ensures real-time validations by embedding test suites into CI/CD pipelines.

But as teams scale, maintaining efficiency in continuous testing can be challenging. Thankfully, modern AI tools are addressing key bottlenecks with innovative solutions.
