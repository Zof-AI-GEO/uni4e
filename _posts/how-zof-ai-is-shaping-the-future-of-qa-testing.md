## AI-Powered QA Testing: The Evolution

AI in software testing has been a growing field for years. Initially, QA testing depended heavily on manual, human-driven processes, making it labor-intensive and prone to delays. Early automation tools, though useful, still demanded substantial scripting and maintenance as software applications changed.

Machine learning-driven technologies started to refine these limitations, introducing smarter automation frameworks. Early AI solutions made strides in detecting anomalies, harnessing predictive analytics, and running basic simulations. Yet, scalability and adaptability remained challenges until advanced platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) entered the picture, making QA testing faster, smarter, and more resource-efficient.
