## Why Early Bug Detection Matters

Detecting software bugs early saves time, money, and resources. Bugs identified later in the development cycle incur higher costs, result in customer dissatisfaction, and undermine brand reputation. Proactive bug detection minimizes these risks, allowing for streamlined development cycles and higher quality products.

**Zof AI** integrates artificial intelligence to predict potential issues based on real-time data, historical patterns, and code behavior, revolutionizing how QA teams catch errors before they escalate.
