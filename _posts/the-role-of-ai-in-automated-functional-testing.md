## Understanding Functional Testing

Functional testing ensures software features operate as intended based on requirement specifications. It evaluates the application's functionality, from basic user interactions to complex system integrations.

### Why Functional Testing Matters

1. **Guarantees Quality:** A flawlessly functioning application fosters user confidence and helps meet high-quality standards.
2. **Minimizes Risks:** Early identification of functional defects prevents costly post-release issues.
3. **Improves Customer Retention:** A polished user experience results in satisfied and loyal customers.
4. **Ensures Compliance:** Adheres to industry practices and regulatory requirements.

While manual and automated testing have long been the norm, AI-driven testing offers transformative advantages in efficiency and accuracy.
