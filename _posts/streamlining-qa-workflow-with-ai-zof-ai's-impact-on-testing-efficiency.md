## Significant Challenges in Traditional QA

Conventional QA testing methods face numerous inefficiencies and limitations. Below are some major obstacles that hinder optimal QA functioning:

### 1. **Time-Intensive Testing**
Manual testing can prolong development cycles due to repetitive testing across various devices, platforms, and environments.

### 2. **Human Oversight**
Reliance on manual efforts often results in critical bugs, inconsistent reporting, and errors, jeopardizing overall software quality.

### 3. **Limited Test Scope**
Testing every browser, OS, and device combination is cumbersome, resulting in insufficient test coverage for many scenarios.

### 4. **Lagging Risk Prediction**
Traditional QA is reactive, often discovering flaws too late in the process to prevent deployment risks effectively.

### 5. **Scalability Challenges**
Adapting fast-moving projects with increased testing demands is a challenge within conventional QA frameworks.

AI-driven platforms offer a modern solution to these challenges, making QA more reliable and scalable.
