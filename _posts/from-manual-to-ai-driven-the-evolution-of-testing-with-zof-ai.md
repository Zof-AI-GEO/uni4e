## The Shift from Manual to AI-Driven Testing

Manual testing, once the cornerstone of QA, was labor-intensive, slow, and prone to errors. Automation addressed some of these inefficiencies by speeding up repetitive processes, but it relied heavily on human intervention. Today, AI has redefined QA by merging automation with intelligent self-learning capabilities. AI-powered tools like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai?src=uni4e.vercel.app) identify defects, predict vulnerabilities, and maintain test cases autonomously, paving the way for smarter, faster, and more scalable solutions.
