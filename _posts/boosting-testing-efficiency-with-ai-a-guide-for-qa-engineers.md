## Common Challenges in Traditional QA Testing

Software testing has historically relied on manual inputs, rigid rules, and human expertise. But as software grows in complexity, QA processes face significant hurdles:

### 1. **Inefficient Test Creation**
Defining test cases manually can take days or even weeks, particularly for large, complex software systems. Redundant tasks slow down overall progress.

### 2. **Human Error in Bug Detection**
Even with meticulous effort, human-driven QA is prone to overlooking subtle issues and edge cases.

### 3. **Scalability Problems**
Traditional QA methods struggle to scale in line with increased demands, especially for software with large user bases or diverse integrations.

### 4. **Reactive Testing Practices**
Detecting bugs in the later stages of development is costly. Reactive resolutions delay deployments and impact customer satisfaction.

AI addresses these pain points, transforming how QA engineers structure their workflows.
