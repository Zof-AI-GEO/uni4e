## Common Pitfalls: Issues with Traditional Bug Detection Methods

Traditional bug detection, relying heavily on manual testing and static automation, faces critical challenges that hinder efficiency:

1. **Human Error:** Manual testing is prone to errors, missed cases, and subjective outcomes.
2. **Time Intensive:** Repeatedly testing hundreds or thousands of cases across environments takes considerable time and resources.
3. **Complexity Challenges:** Modern systems with APIs, third-party integrations, and unstructured data make it hard to catch every bug.
4. **Static Automation Limitations:** Predefined automation scripts lack adaptability to new requirements and hidden errors.
5. **Edge Cases Overlooked:** Diverse platforms, devices, and configurations leave room for untested scenarios, increasing the risk of missed bugs.

Manual approaches often result in delayed releases, higher costs, and compromised user trust. Clearly, a shift toward intelligent tools like Zof AI is urgently needed.
