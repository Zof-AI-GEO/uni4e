## What is AI in Software Testing?

Software testing ensures applications function reliably while maintaining performance, security, and usability. Traditionally, testing involved highly manual and time-intensive tasks, prone to errors and incapable of scaling with modern application complexity.

AI reshapes testing by introducing automation, offering predictive defect identification, and adapting to codebase changes. These tools, like **Zof AI**, analyze extensive data, simulate real-world user scenarios, and provide actionable insights, ensuring QA teams align with demanding software delivery timelines.
