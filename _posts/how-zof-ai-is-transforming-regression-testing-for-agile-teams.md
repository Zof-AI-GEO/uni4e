## Top Challenges of Regression Testing in Agile

**1. Time Constraints:** Short sprint cycles leave little room for lengthy regression processes, creating bottlenecks when relying on manual or outdated methods.  
**2. Evolving Requirements:** Iterative development requires constant updates to test suites, often delaying critical testing tasks.  
**3. Extensive Test Cases:** Larger systems bring sprawling test suites, rendering manual case management nearly impossible.  
**4. Risk of Human Error:** Manual testing often leads to missed bugs, incomplete coverage, or errors in identifying critical issues.  
**5. Increased Costs:** Longer testing cycles drain resources and delay releases, forcing trade-offs between speed and quality.
