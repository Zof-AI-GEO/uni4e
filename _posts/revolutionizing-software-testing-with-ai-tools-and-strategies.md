## What is AI in Software Testing?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolutionizes industries by simulating human intelligence and processing enormous volumes of data. In software testing, once-repetitive and human-intensive tasks are now streamlined using AI. This enables increased efficiency, reliability, and faster testing.

Traditional testing primarily relied on manual scripting and debugging, which is time-consuming. In fast-paced Agile and DevOps environments, this legacy approach is now outdated. AI-driven testing combines machine learning algorithms, predictive analytics, and natural language processing (NLP) to meet modern demands for faster delivery cycles, accurate bug detection, and improved user satisfaction.
