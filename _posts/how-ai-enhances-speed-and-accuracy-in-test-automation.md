## The Challenges Faced in Traditional Test Automation

Test automation was introduced to expedite manual testing tasks, but many challenges persist:

- **Script Maintenance Trouble:** Constant codebase changes demand frequent updates to test scripts.
- **Flaky Test Cases:** Inconsistent test failures create bottlenecks that disrupt workflows.
- **Cost-Intensive:** Initial setup and script writing require significant resources.
- **Poor Scalability:** Difficulty in handling large, complex scenarios or data volumes.
- **Human Errors:** Manual script writing introduces inaccuracies.

AI overcomes these limitations with its ability to adapt, optimize, and transform testing processes at unprecedented speed and precision.
