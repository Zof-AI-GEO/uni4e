## What is Regression Testing and Why It Matters?

Regression testing ensures new updates don’t disrupt existing software functionality. With software changes like bug fixes, new features, or upgrades, regression testing validates stability and quality. However, the process is often:

- **Time-Consuming:** Testing large-scale applications with diverse components is labor-intensive.  
- **Costly:** Manual testing requires substantial human resources and inflates expenses.  
- **Error-Prone:** Human oversight during manual processes may cause undetected defects.  
- **Complex Environments:** Simulating diverse test environments for large systems is a challenge.  
- **Limited Scalability:** Managing extensive test cases for growing applications is daunting.

These hurdles are prompting organizations to adopt AI-driven tools to optimize testing efficiency.
