## Challenges in Traditional QA Testing Methods

### 1. Resource Limitations
Manual QA demands significant human effort, but stretched teams often miss critical issues.

### 2. Time Constraints
Manual testing delays releases, especially during regression or exploratory testing phases.

### 3. Human Error
Even expert testers can miss errors, especially when tackling lengthy or repetitive tasks.

### 4. Scaling Issues
Ensuring consistent QA coverage for large applications strains resources without automation.
