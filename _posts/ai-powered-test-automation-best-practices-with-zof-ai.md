## How AI is Transforming Test Automation

### The Challenges of Traditional Testing:
1. **Rigid Test Scripts**: Traditional scripts are inflexible and require frequent updates as applications evolve.
2. **High Error Rates**: Conventional testing often results in false positives or negatives.
3. **Scalability Issues**: Standard tools falter as project complexities increase.

AI introduces dynamic adaptability, making testing more efficient and predictive. Tools like Zof AI leverage machine learning and natural language processing to evolve alongside your application, simplify debugging, and enhance scalability.
