## Challenges with Traditional Regression Testing

Regression testing is crucial, but conventional methods come with significant challenges that impede agility and efficiency. Common hurdles include:

### **1. Resource-Heavy and Time-Consuming**
Manual test case creation, maintenance, and execution require substantial manpower. As systems evolve, testers often spend time maintaining outdated test scripts rather than focusing on innovative solutions.

### **2. Lack of Scalable Solutions**
When applications grow larger, manual regression testing becomes impractical, with hours or days required to complete, leading to limited test coverage.

### **3. High Maintenance Costs**
Updating test suites to accommodate codebase changes is labor-intensive and expensive, creating a financial strain on organizations.

### **4. Human Error Risks**
Manual testing increases the likelihood of missed defects, particularly over repeated testing cycles that lead to tester fatigue.
