## Understanding AI’s Role in Software Testing

AI’s integration into software testing is more than a trend—it's a paradigm shift. Traditional QA hinges on manual testing and pre-defined automated scripts, which struggle with scalability and handling ever-evolving systems. AI introduces groundbreaking capabilities like predictive analytics, intelligent automation, and machine learning, enabling a more adaptive approach to testing.

AI learns from historical data to detect patterns, anticipate potential failures, and offer automated solutions. By eliminating repetitive tasks, AI builds dynamic, intelligent test environments that evolve with real-time code changes and user behavior.
