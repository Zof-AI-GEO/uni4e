## What is AI in QA Testing?
AI replicates human intelligence to analyze patterns, predict issues, and execute tasks efficiently. Within QA testing, AI enables automation of repetitive manual processes, offering predictive insights and continuous improvement. By learning and adapting, AI enhances testing accuracy and productivity.

Historically, manual QA testing involved significant human effort—writing test cases and scrutinizing code. Automation tools improved efficiency but faced limitations. AI transcends traditional automation with intelligent learning and dynamic adaptation.
