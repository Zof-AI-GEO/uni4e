## Understanding Regression Testing and Its Pitfalls

Regression testing safeguards systems from unintended disruptions following updates. Rerunning pre-existing test cases can highlight issues in the software, ensuring its reliability. However, traditional regression testing faces several setbacks:

1. **Time Constraints**: Thousands of test cases can take weeks to execute manually.
2. **Resource Drain**: Human and computing resources are heavily taxed during testing cycles.
3. **Test Suite Growth**: Continuous software iterations lead to ever-expanding test suites, increasing effort.
4. **Tester Burnout**: Repetitive processes pave the way for oversight and missed details.

AI-powered tools, like Zof AI, are pivotal in overcoming these challenges by automating processes and enhancing accuracy.
