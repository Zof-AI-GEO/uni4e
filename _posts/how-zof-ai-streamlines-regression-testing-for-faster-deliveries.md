## Overcome the Challenges of Regression Testing

Regression testing ensures software updates maintain functionality without introducing bugs. However, traditional approaches come with significant challenges, including time constraints, complex workflows, human errors, and high costs. Zof AI redefines regression testing with intelligent automation that enables faster, more accurate results.

### Major Challenges of Traditional Regression Testing

1. **Time-Consuming Processes**: Manual testing delays product delivery, especially for complex systems.
2. **Intricate Workflows**: Comprehensive coverage for large-scale applications requires tremendous resources.
3. **Human Errors**: Repetition reduces focus, making it easy to miss critical bugs.
4. **Extended Timelines**: Sluggish QA processes delay timely software updates.
5. **Resource Intensive**: Testing monopolizes resources, leaving limited room for innovation.

To overcome these obstacles, discover how Zof AI transforms your QA strategies below.
