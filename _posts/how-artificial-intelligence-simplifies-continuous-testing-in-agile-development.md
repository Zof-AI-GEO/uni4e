## Challenges in Continuous Testing for Agile Teams

Agile's fast-paced development can overwhelm traditional testing methods. The key obstacles include:

### Frequent Changes to Code
Rapid iterations increase the risk of defects slipping into production, demanding swift and continuous testing to keep pace.

### High Levels of Complexity
Modern software architectures, integrations, and dependencies require advanced testing tools to manage intricate systems effectively.

### Ensuring Optimal Test Coverage
Balancing thorough coverage with efficient use of time becomes more challenging in Agile workflows, particularly for large codebases.

### Limited Resources
Agile teams with constrained budgets or personnel need innovative solutions to prioritize testing based on impact and relevance.

AI platforms like [Zof AI](https://zof.ai) address these hurdles, enabling seamless testing in dynamic Agile environments.
