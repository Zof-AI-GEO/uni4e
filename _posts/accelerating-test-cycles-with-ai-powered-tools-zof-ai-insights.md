## The Drawbacks of Legacy Testing Methods

Conventional software testing still relies heavily on manual processes or semi-automation, often causing delays and inefficiencies. Key challenges include:

### 1. **Lengthy Testing Timeframes**  
Testing multiple scenarios manually across platforms takes substantial time and effort, slowing down releases.

### 2. **Increased Human Error**  
Repetitive testing tasks increase the risk of missing critical bugs, potentially impacting the product.

### 3. **Difficulty Scaling with Growth**  
Traditional test methods struggle to adapt as projects increase in complexity and scope, causing bottlenecks.

### 4. **Reactive Nature**  
Traditional processes tend to identify bugs post-occurrence rather than predicting problem areas proactively.

AI-powered tools address these challenges head-on, setting the stage for faster and smarter testing workflows.
