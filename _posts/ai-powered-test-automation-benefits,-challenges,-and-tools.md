## Understanding AI-Powered Test Automation

AI-powered test automation leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to streamline and enhance software testing. Unlike traditional test automation, which requires labor-intensive script writing and maintenance, AI solutions adapt dynamically to application changes. By learning from historical data and user interactions, AI-based tools can automatically generate, prioritize, and modify test cases. This approach reduces manual intervention, enabling QA engineers to focus on solving more complex problems.

AI-driven platforms excel in anomaly detection, risk prediction, and adaptive test maintenance, ensuring better accuracy in identifying software bugs and vulnerabilities. As businesses prioritize efficiency, AI-powered testing offers a promising solution to meet modern development demands.
